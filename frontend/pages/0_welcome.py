    Welcome to my interactive AIâ€‘Portfolio!

    This app gives a glimpse into how I integrate AI â€” blending LLMs and (backend-)engineering into prototypes that can scale into real products.

    What you can do here:
    - Chat with an AI about my background, projects, and skills.
    - Browse and download my CV as a PDF.
    - Explore the source code on GitHub and connect on LinkedIn via the links in the left sidebar.

    Under the hood:
    - Frontend: Streamlit
    - API: FastAPI
    - LLM: OpenAI Chat Completions (toolâ€‘calling)
    - Architecture: Clean Architecture (domain â€¢ use cases â€¢ adapters)

    If youâ€™re interested in me or my work, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
